--> color theme changes when scrolling into a new section
    --> thought: try to make a smoother transition
        --> idea: use fast gradient to ease the transition
    --> ie: when scrolling into the "portfolio" section, the color theme changes to a red color
    --> ex: https://unicorn-utterances.com/collections/framework-field-guide

--> sticky scrolling ?
    --> ex: https://webflow.com/made-in-webflow/website/Starry-Skies-Sticky-Horizontal-Scroll-Demo
    --> thought: could work well with the color theme change when scrolling into a new section
                 and allow for better transitions between sections
