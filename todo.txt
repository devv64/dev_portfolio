--> color theme changes when scrolling into a new section
    --> thought: try to make a smoother transition
        --> idea: use fast gradient to ease the transition
    --> ie: when scrolling into the "portfolio" section, the color theme changes to a red color
    --> ex: https://unicorn-utterances.com/collections/framework-field-guide

    * Not working well. Having issues with transparancy

--> use a horizontal scroll for the portfolio section ?

--> sticky scrolling ?
    --> ex: https://webflow.com/made-in-webflow/website/Starry-Skies-Sticky-Horizontal-Scroll-Demo
    --> thought: could work well with the color theme change when scrolling into a new section
                 and allow for better transitions between sections



portfolio projects:
    --> SG Headless CMS
    --> Dev's Blog Site
    --> SplitIt
    --> weatherApp
    --> ShuPU
    --> All Star Site (while necessary)
    --> WiseQuackers
    --> InternTrack (in progress)
    --> Maybe tiling the courtyard with video demo

currently all on one page
two potential different pages:

* maybe contact should be on the original page
contact:
    basics:
        --> email
        --> linkedin
        --> github
        --> discord
    creative:
        --> calendar type thing to schedule a meeting

fun:
    concept: page that has lots of fun (engaging) things to do
    ex: https://neal.fun/
    ex: https://www.boredbutton.com/
    ex: https://www.koalastothemax.com/
    ex: https://theuselessweb.com/
    ex: https://pointerpointer.com/
    ex: https://www.fallingfalling.com/

    ** could be better to have this as a separate deployment
    this is getting too much for a portfolio site
